### Hi there, I'm John ðŸ‘‹

I recently competed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) after leaving my first programming job at the [MusÃ©um national d'Histoire naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr) where, among other projects, I developed the backend for the recently released version 4 of the [INPN EspÃ¨ces mobile app](https://inpn.mnhn.fr/accueil/participer/inpn-especes). Before that, I worked as a biologist for the National Park Service restoring tallgrass prairies. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: [houseplants-api](https://github.com/jdholding/houseplants-api) - a Spring Boot backend for an app idea to manage my many houseplants
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Funcuntional programming through Haskell
